            React is a JavaScript library for building user. <br>
            React is used to build single page. <br>
            React allows us to create reusable UI.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Create React App
            In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.
            This tutorial uses the create-react-app.
            The create-react-app is an officially supported way to create React applications.
            If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the
            create-react-app.
            Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal : <br>
            <code> C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app</code> <br>You are now ready to create your first
            React application!
            Run this command to create a React application named <br /><code> C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app
              myfirstreact</code>

          <p><b>What is React?</b><br>
            React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.<br>
            React is a tool for building UI components.<br>
            <b>How does React Work?</b><br>
            React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
            Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all
            the necessary
            manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
            React only changes what needs to be changed!
            React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
            You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.<br>
            <b>React.JS History</b><br>
            Current version of React.JS is V16.8.6 (March 2019).
            Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.
            React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.
            Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.
            The create-react-app version 2.0 package was released in October 2018.
            Create-react-app version 2.0 supports Babel 7, webpack 4, and Jest23.</p>

            To use React in production, you need NPM and Node.js
            To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code directly in HTML.
            But in order to use React in production, you need NPM and Node.js installed.<br>
            <b>React Directly in HTML</b><br>
            The quickest way start learning React is to write React directly in your HTML files.
            Start by including three scripts, the first two let us write React code in our JavaScripts,
            and the third, Babel, allows us to write JSX syntax and ES6 in older browsers
          </p>
          <code>
            class Hello extends React.Component { <br>
            render() { <br>
            return <br>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            }<br>
            }<br>
            ReactDOM.render(<Hello></Hello>, document.getElementById('mydiv'))
          </code>
          <p>
            <b>Setting up a React Environment</b><br>
            If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the
            create-react-app.
            If you've already created the create-react-app you can skip this section.
            Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:<br> <code>
              C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app</code><br>
            Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one called myfirstreact.
            Run this command to create a React application named myfirstreact:<br>
            <code> C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app myfirstreact</code><br>
            The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.<br>
            <b>Run the React Application</b><br>
            Now you are ready to run your first real React application!
            Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:<br>
            <code>C:\Users\Your Name>cd myfirstreact</code><br>
            Run this command to run the React application myfirstreact:<br>
            <code>C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start</code> <br>
            A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type
            localhost:3000 in the address bar.

            <header style="text-decoration: underline;">React ES6</header>
            <article>
              <b>What is ES6?</b><br>
              ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
              ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was
              published
              in 2015, and is also
              known as ECMAScript 2015.<br>
              <b>Why Should I Learn ES6?</b><br>
              React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:
              <ul>
                <li>Classes</li>
                <li>Arrow Functions</li>
                <li>Variables (let, const, var)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Classes</b><br>
                ES6 introduced classes.
                A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it,
                we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.<br>
                <b>Class Inheritance</b><br>
                To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.
                A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:The super() method
                refers to the parent class.
                By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and
                gets
                access to the parent's
                properties and methods.
                <code><br>
                  class Car {<br>
                  constructor(name) {<br>
                  this.brand = name;<br>
                  }
                  present() {<br>
                  return 'I have a ' + this.brand;<br>
                  }
                  }
                  class Model extends Car {<br>
                  constructor(name, mod) {<br>
                  super(name);<br>
                  this.model = mod;<br>
                  }
                  show() {<br>
                  return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model <br> }
                  }
                  mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");<br>
                  mycar.show();<br>
                  class Hello extends React.Component {<br>
                  render() {<br>
                  return Hello World!<br>
                  }
                  }
                  ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('mydiv'))<br>
                </code></p>
              The super() method refers to the parent class.
              By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets
              access to the parent's
              properties and methods.<br>
              <b>Arrow Functions</b> <br>
              Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
              Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:<br>
              <b>What About this?</b>
              The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.
              In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of this.
              In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the
              window, the document,
              a button or whatever.
              With arrow functions, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.
              Let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference.
              Both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, and once again when the user clicks a
              button.
              The first example uses a regular function, and the second example uses an arrow function.
              The result shows that the first example returns two different objects (window and button), and the second
              example returns the Header
              object twice.<br>
              <b>Variables</b><br>
              Before ES6 there were only one way of defining your variables: with the var keyword. If you did not define
              them, they would be
              assigned to the global object. Unless you were in strict mode, then you would get an error if your
              variables
              were undefined.
              Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables: var, let, and const.

            <header style="text-decoration: underline;">Render HTML</header>
            <p>
              React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.
              React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called ReactDOM.render().
              The Render Function
              The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
              The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Root Node
              The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.
              It is like a container for content managed by React.
              It does NOT have to be a element and it does NOT have to have the id='root':

            <article>
              <p>
                <b>What is JSX?</b><br>
                JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
                JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
                JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.<br>
                <b>Coding JSX</b><br>
                JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()
                and/or appendChild()
                methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.<br><code>const myelement = I Love JSX!;

                  ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));</code>
              </p>
              <p><b>Expressions in JSX</b><br>
                With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
                The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression. JSX will
                execute the
                expression and return the result:

                Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript
                functions,
                but work in
                isolation and returns HTML via a render function.
                Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will
                concentrate
                on Class
                components.
                Create a Class Component
                When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.
                The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an
                inheritance
                to
                React.Component,
                and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
                The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.<br>
                <code>class Car extends React.Component {<br>
                  render() {<br>
                  return Hi, I am a Car!;<br>
                  }
                  }
                </code>

              <p>
                Props are arguments passed into React components.
                Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
                React Props
                React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
                To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:
              </p>

          <section class="main-section" id="React_State" style="background-color: lightblue;">
            <header style="text-decoration: underline;">React State</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                React components has a built-in state object.
                The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
                When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
                Creating the state Object
                The state object is initialized in the constructor:
                <code>class Car extends React.Component {
                  constructor(props) {
                  super(props);
                  this.state = {brand: "Ford"};
                  }
                  render() {
                  return (
                  My Car
                  );
                  }
                  }</code>

          <section class="main-section" id="React_Lifecycle">
            <header style="text-decoration: underline;">React Lifecycle</header>
            <article>
              <p>Lifecycle of Components
                Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main
                phases.
                The three phases are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Mounting</li>
                  <li>Updating</li>
                  <li>Unmounting</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
                React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:
                <ul>
                  <li>constructor()</li>
                  <li>getDerivedStateFromProps()</li>
                  <li>render()</li>
                  <li>componentDidMount()</li>
                </ul>
                The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if
                you
                define them.</p>
              <p>Updating
                The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.
                A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
                React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:<br>
                getDerivedStateFromProps()<br>
                shouldComponentUpdate()<br>
                render()<br>
                getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()<br>
                componentDidUpdate()<br>
                The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if
                you
                define them.</p>
              <p>Unmounting
                The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React
                likes
                to
                call it.
                React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:<br>
                componentWillUnmount()<br>
                componentWillUnmount <br>
                The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.</p>

            <article>
              Just like HTML, React can perform actions based on user events.
              React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.Adding Events
              React events are written in camelCase syntax:
              onClick instead of onclick.
              React event handlers are written inside curly braces:
              onClick={shoot} instead of onClick="shoot()"

            <article>
              Just like in HTML, React uses forms to allow users to interact with the web page.
              Adding Forms in React
              You add a form with React like any other element:
              <code>class MyForm extends React.Component {<br>
                render() {<br>
                return (<br>
                Hello <br>
                Enter your name: <br>
                );
                }
                }
                ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));</code>
              <p>
                Handling Forms
                Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.
                In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.
                In React, form data is usually handled by the components.
                When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.
                You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute: <br /><code>
                  class MyForm extends React.Component { <br>
                  constructor(props) {<br>
                  super(props);<br>
                  this.state = { username: '' };<br>
                  }
                  myChangeHandler = (event) => {<br>
                  this.setState({username: event.target.value});<br>
                  }<br>
                  render() {<br>
                  return (<br>
                  Hello {this.state.username}<br>
                  Enter your name:<br>
                  );
                  }
                  }
                  ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));</code>

              here are many ways to style React with CSS, this tutorial will take a closer look at inline styling, and
              CSS
              stylesheet.
              Inline Styling
              To style an element with the inline style attribute, the value must be a JavaScript object:
              <code>class MyHeader extends React.Component { <br>
                render() {<br>
                return (<br>
                Hello Style!<br>
                Add a little style!<br>
                );
                }
                }</code>

              What is Sass
              Sass is a CSS pre-processor.
              Sass files are executed on the server and sends CSS to the browser.
              You can learn more about Sass in our Sass Tutorial.
              Can I use Sass?
              If you use the create-react-app in your project, you can easily install and use Sass in your React
              projects.
              Install Sass by running this command in your <code>C:\Users\Your Name>npm install node-sass</code>
              <p>Create a Sass file
                Create a Sass file the same way as you create CSS files, but Sass files have the file extension .scss
                In Sass files you can use variables and other Sass <br /><code>$myColor: red;
                  h1 {
                  color: $myColor;
                  }</code></p>
